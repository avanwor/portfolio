# Andy's Portfolio

<!-- insert success message -->

The first iteration of my personal site built with [React](https://www.reactjs.org/) and hosted with [github](https://www.github.com/).

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

## Building and Running for Production

In addition to the development server started with `yarn start`, you can also generate a full static production build and serve that to preview the site as it will appear once deployed:

```sh
yarn build
```

```sh
yarn serve
```

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories in this project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── README.md

1. **`/node_modules`**: The directory where all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2. **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser), like your site header, or a page template. “Src” is a convention for “source code”.

3. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
